    Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more.
    It reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing
    frequently-requested web pages. Squid has extensive access controls and
    makes a great server accelerator. It runs on most available operating
    systems, including Windows and is licensed under the GNU GPL.
